Generates icons/boards of icons, given a json description of the build order.

For an example of a build order, see broadorder.json.


The order description language is as follows:

{ 
	"seed" : 333,	%the seed for generating a random batch of icons repeatably
	"hexagonally packed" : true,	%alters the layout of multiple icon batches. Prettier when true.
	"number of rows" : 16,
	"number of columns" : 22,
	"distance between faces" : 37,
	"face border diameter" : 31,	%concerning the circle that is drawin behind faces. Set to 0 for no circle.
	"face diameter" : 24,
	"hexagon protrusion" : 0,	%0 or a small value is optimal
	"output file name" : "broad.png",
	"iterative" : false,	%defaults to false, when true, there is no random, renders each possible icon, one after the other.
	"background color" :
		{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},	%doesn't use an alpha value yet, I should add that..
	"face plaque color" :	%color of the 'border'
		{"r":0.2,"g":0.2,"b":0.2},
	"face color" :
		{"r":0.94,"g":0.94,"b":1}
}
